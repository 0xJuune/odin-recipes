    <h2>Sweet, sweet Raspberry mixed with Gin, Lime, and Ginger.</h2>
    <p>A complex but refreshingly fruity cocktail! Lovely on hot days or if you're craving sweet carbonation. Be warned: You have to love Raspberries and can't be afraid of ginger undertones. One of my all time favorite drinks.</p>

    <p><em>Note: You should have Ice, a Cocktail Shaker, and something to Muddle with for this drink.</em></p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2oz Gin</li>
        <li>1/2oz Simple Syrup</li>
        <li>2 Limes (or 3/4oz Lime Juice)</li>
        <li>A small handful of Raspberries</li>
        <li>Ginger Ale</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
    <li>Start off by squeezing your limes for juice and add it to the shaker.</li>
    <li>Add your Raspberries to your shaker, and muddle them finely.</li>
    <li>Next, take the rest of your measured liquids and add them to your shaker. <strong>Save the Ginger Ale for last!</strong></strong></li>
    <li>Shake the ingredients heavily, double strain into glass, and serve on ice. Top off the drink with a splash of Ginger Ale.</li></ol>
