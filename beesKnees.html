    <h1>Bee's Knees</h1>

    <h2>A refreshing Gin-based cocktail for lovers of Lemon and Honey!</h2>
    <p>Served in a chilled glass and shaken on ice, this uplifting drink is perfect after a warm spring day. The Gin's Juniper undertones pair well with the natural flavors of Lemon and Honey, creating a tastefully airy set of flavors.</p>
    <p>You can use whatever class of Gin you prefer, although I lean towards something with noticeable Juniper aroma. You can even try White Rum if you'd like something with more kick, and less flowery taste but it's not the traditional way of making this drink. Feel free to experiment with garnishes! For this cocktail, I'll usually throw a Lemon wheel and honey (or sugar) on the rim!</p>
    <p>Note: You should have Ice and a Cocktail Shaker on hand for this drink, and you should prepare by chilling a glass in a freeze for a couple of minutes.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2oz Gin</li>
        <li>1/2oz Honey Syrup</li>
        <li>2 Lemons (or 1/2oz Lemon Juice)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
    <li>Start off by squeezing your lemons for juice. If you want an easy Garnish, set aside 1 Lemon Slice about 1cm thick.</li>
    <li>Next, take all three of your measured liquids and add them to your shaker of choice.</li>
    <li>Shake the ingredients together for a few seconds, strain into a chilled glass, and serve. </li></ol>
