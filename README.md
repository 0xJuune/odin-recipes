# odin-recipes
This is another project for The Odin Project (TOP) for practicing HTML code and commit ability. 

The assignment is broken up into 4 recommended iterations:

- Iteration 1) Initial Structure: Setting up the initial index.html page. 
- Iteration 2) Recipe Page: Adding a new page named after a food dish, and linking to the newly crated page from the index.html page.
- Iteration 3) Recipe Page Content: Adding content to the recipe page such as images and information to complete the recipe.
- Iteration 4) Add More Recipes: Taking the template for the recipe page and using it to create recipe pages for other foods/drinks. Link them in the index.html file.

After completion, I'll have shown the ability to create a simple informational website with features like relative linking, only in HTML with no CSS.
