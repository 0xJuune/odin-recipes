    <h2>"Baby's First Bourbon"</h2>
    <p>Every friend I've had that claims to not like any forms of bourbon are swayed with this recipe. It cuts away the hardness of bourbon, and smooths it out with sweet tones of honey and just a splash of grapefruit.</p>
    <p>The funny thing is, I don't even like grapefruit. Yet, this has become one of my favorite go-to easy drink to make. It really seems to smooth out the edges of any bourbon I throw at it.</p>
    <p>Note: You should have Ice and a Cocktail Shaker on hand for this drink.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2oz Bourbon</li>
        <li>1/2oz Honey Syrup</li>
        <li>1 Grapefruit (or 1/2oz Grapefruit Juice)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
    <li>Start off by squeezing your grapefruits for juice. If you want an easy Garnish, peel a section of the grapefruit and twist it.</li>
    <li>Add a small amount of ice to your shaker of choice.</li>
    <li>Next, take all three of your measured liquids and add them to your shaker.</li>
    <li>Shake the ingredients together for a few seconds, strain into glass, and serve.</li></ol>
